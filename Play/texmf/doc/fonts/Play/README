This is the README for the Play package, version 0.0.1 (2021/01/09).
  
This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX support for the Play family of fonts,
designed by Jonas Hecksher. 

To use, add

     \usepackage{Play}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate Play
as the text font. 

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the fonts.


Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1.

The original TrueType fonts were obtained from

      https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play#about

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, version
1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory. The type1
versions were created using cfftot1. The support files were
created using autoinst and are licensed under the terms of
the LaTeX Project Public License. The maintainer of this
package is Carl-Clemens Ebinger at post(at)ebinger(dot)cc.
